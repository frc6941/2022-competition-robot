## Code Structure
1. Subsystems: the collection with the basic hardwares, along with the basic functions that controls them.
2. Coordinators: higher level abstractions of multiple subsystem, carrying out a coordinated behavior.
3. Commands: something that calls a function defined in the subsystems.

## Units and Positive Directions
1. Use METER as the unit of length. NO INCHES, FEETS AND YARDS. NO CENTIMETERS AND MILIMETERS. Transition will be stated explicitly.
2. Use DERGREE as the unit of angle. NO RADIANS.
3. Take CLOCKWISE (abbreviated as CW) as the positive direction of rotation. NO CONTER-CLOCKWISE (abbreviated as CCW) unless stated explicitly.
