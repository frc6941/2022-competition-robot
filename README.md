## Code Structure

1. Subsystems: the collection with the basic hardware, along with the basic functions that controls them.
2. Coordinators: higher level abstractions of multiple subsystem, carrying out a coordinated behavior.
3. Commands: something that calls a function defined in the subsystems.

## Units and Positive Directions

1. Use METER as the unit of length. NO INCHES, FEET AND YARDS. NO CENTIMETERS AND MILLIMETERS. Transition will be stated explicitly.
2. Use DEGREE as the unit of angle. NO RADIANS.
3. Take COUNTER-CLOCKWISE (abbreviated as CCW) as the positive direction of rotation. NO CLOCKWISE (abbreviated as CCW) unless stated explicitly.
